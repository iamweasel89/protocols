# Scaling reference

> **Status:** deferred reference. Revisit when memory passes ~30 nodes
> or after 2026-08-31, whichever comes first.
This leaf is **not a current task**. It is a reference for three problems that
become real as the memory grows. While the project has fewer than ~30 nodes,
these problems are negligible: the operator sees the whole tree at once.

Triggered by the `purpose` field in `n800.json` and by the `review_after`
field above. Read this when the trigger fires, decide which (if any) of the
mechanisms below to introduce.

## Problem 1: Staleness

Reality changes, leaves stay. Without a freshness mechanism, an LLM reads
outdated content as if current.

**Option A — `last_verified` per leaf.**
Add `last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD` to leaf frontmatter. On gardening pass,
find the oldest dates and re-check them against code. Cheap, no new files.
Already added to the spec as an optional field (see `protocols/project-memory.md`).

**Option B — freshness index near root.**
A single `memory/freshness.json` listing all leaves with their dates.
Lets the operator see all stale nodes in one glance, without opening each leaf.
Worth introducing around 50+ nodes.

**Option C — summary attribute on branches.**
Each branch carries `oldest_descendant: YYYY-MM-DD`. The operator descends
only into branches that need attention. Requires a script to maintain.
Worth introducing around 200+ nodes.

## Problem 2: Duplicates and overlaps

Two leaves about the same topic in different branches. The LLM may read both
and get confused, or read one and miss the other.

**Option A — DRY rule in `n802`.**
Already added: before creating a new leaf, check whether one already exists
on the same topic. If yes, link to it, do not duplicate. Cheap, manual.

**Option B — topics index.**
A `memory/topics.json` mapping topic strings to leaf IDs. Before creating
a new leaf, the LLM checks the index. Useful around 50+ nodes when the
operator can no longer remember every leaf.

**Option C — periodic overlap audit.**
Every month or after big changes, ask the LLM to walk all `purpose` fields
and flag pairs that overlap. Cheap, point-in-time check, no maintenance.

## Problem 3: Hidden content

A leaf with badly written `purpose` becomes invisible — the LLM never opens it.
Cannot be fully solved while preserving lazy loading; can only be mitigated.

**Option A — forced full sweep.**
On request, the LLM reads every leaf and verifies that the body matches the purpose.
Expensive in tokens, but reliable. For occasional revisions only.

**Option B — control questions.**
The operator asks the LLM something the operator already knows. If the LLM
cannot find the answer in memory, something is hidden. A probe, not a check.

**Option C — fallback path.**
In `n802` document an explicit fallback: "if `purpose` does not match,
check the topics index / queue / specific leaf." Does not fix the problem,
softens its consequences.

## What to do when the trigger fires

1. Count the leaves. Re-evaluate whether scaling pressure is real.
2. Pick the smallest mechanism that addresses the actual pain — do not
   introduce all options at once.
3. If you adopt a mechanism, add it as a normal node in `memory/` and
   update this leaf to reflect what was chosen.
4. Update `review_after` to a new date.
