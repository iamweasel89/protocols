# Memory queue

Things to develop in the memory system itself.
Order reflects priority discussed 2026-05-02.

## 1. First leaf node

Done. `n900` itself was the first leaf, then `n801`, `n802`, `n803`.
Spec held up; minor extensions accumulated naturally.

## 2. `code_ref` format

Decide what `code_ref` actually contains: commit hash, file path, build tag,
GitHub URL, or some combination. Without this, each leaf will choose differently.
Pending: still no leaf has used `code_ref` so the question is not pressing.

## 3. Leaf types

Decide subtypes for `kind: leaf`: feature / decision / question / protocol /
current-state / something else. The first content leaf will force this question.

## 4. Cross-branch links

Add support for non-parent links: `alternative_to`, `supersedes`, `depends_on`.
Will be needed once two or more features start referencing each other.
See `n801` for PENgram's edge vocabulary as a starting point.

## 5. Render

A way to see the tree as a picture, not as a folder of JSON files. Simplest:
Mermaid block in `memory/overview.md`, regenerated on changes.
See `n801` for `llm-wiki-skill`'s `graph.html` as a more advanced reference.

## 6. Self-aware node

A node in `memory/` that describes the memory approach itself, with a link to
`protocols/project-memory.md`. Partly addressed by `memory/README.md`,
but a dedicated leaf may still be useful when the project gains a second
audience (collaborators, other LLMs).

## 7. Trigger registry

Currently a single triggered node exists (`n803`, with revisit-after date).
When triggers reach 3+ or any becomes critical, introduce a centralized
registry near root (e.g. `memory/triggers.md` or a dedicated branch),
so any LLM entering memory sees overdue items at once. Until then,
triggers live inside the parent `purpose` and inside the node's frontmatter.
