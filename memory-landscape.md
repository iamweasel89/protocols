# Landscape of similar approaches

Surveyed 2026-05-02. The space is active: at least a dozen teams are independently
converging on similar primitives (structured memory, lazy loading, typed relations).

## Closest neighbours

### PENgram (DEV Community, late April 2026)
Article "We Fixed Karpathy's LLM Wiki". Adds typed relationships
(supersedes, contradicts, depends_on) on top of plain wikilinks. Discrete edge types.
Same direction as our queue item 4 (cross-branch links).

### LLM Wiki v2 (rohitg00, GitHub gist, late April 2026)
Tier-based knowledge graph layered on Karpathy's wiki. Promotes information
up tiers as evidence accumulates. Typed graph over markdown pages.

### llm-wiki-skill (llmrix, GitHub)
Claude Code skill. On ingest, builds both wiki pages AND graph.json + graph.html
visualization. Has the renderer we deferred (queue item 5).

### H-MEM (arxiv 2507.22925, July 2025)
Hierarchical memory for LLM agents. Multi-level by semantic abstraction.
Index-based routing: each memory vector points to related submemories at the next layer.
Conceptually identical to our purpose-driven descent.

### L-RAG (arxiv 2601.06551, 2026)
Two-tier context: compact summary first, detailed chunks only when needed.
Entropy-based gating decides when to descend. Same lazy-loading idea as ours.

### Bill of Lading (Medium, November 2025)
Manifest-style context architecture: segments stored separately, manifest specifies
what to load for each inference pass. Closest in spirit to our JSON-as-navigation.

### Git Context Controller (arxiv 2508.00031, August 2025)
Agent context as Git: COMMIT, BRANCH, MERGE, CONTEXT operations.
Multi-resolution retrieval. Useful precedent if we add branching/merging of memory paths.

## What differentiates our approach

1. **JSON navigation as a separate layer over markdown.**
   Others embed navigation inside markdown via wikilinks (PENgram, LLM Wiki v2).
   We keep it physically separate. Cheaper for machines to read, requires renderer for humans.

2. **`purpose` as free-form intent of reading, on every link.**
   PENgram uses discrete edge types (supersedes, contradicts).
   We use a sentence describing why descend. Different axis; the two are combinable.

3. **ID-neutral filenames.**
   Everyone else uses semantic filenames (`transformer-architecture.md`).
   We deliberately use `n023.json` to keep the spec portable across projects.
   Appears unique among surveyed approaches.

4. **Project memory, not knowledge base.**
   All surveyed work targets knowledge bases (research notes, docs, code understanding).
   We target project state: what is built, what is planned, what is deferred.
   Different semantics, different right answers.

## Items to revisit when working on the queue

- Queue item 4 (cross-branch links) → look at PENgram's edge vocabulary first.
- Queue item 5 (render) → look at llm-wiki-skill's graph.html as reference.
- Future branching of memory paths → look at Git Context Controller.

## Status note

We are not first to the idea. We are early in this specific combination.
The space is moving fast: this leaf may become outdated within 2-3 months.
Refresh before relying on the comparisons.
